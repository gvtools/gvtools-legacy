This is the gvSIG Community Edition logo, created by the gvSIG CE project team.
(c) 2011 by the gvSIG CE project team (http://gvsigce.sourceforge.net).

HOW TO USE

This logo has been created using the software available at http://www.inscape.org.
The original vectorial artwork is contained in the two Inkscape SVG files.

For rasterized versions, it is recommended to use the flat design in 
"logo-2d.svg" for sizes between 8 and 64 pixels.

From 64 pixels upward, the more stylish "logo-3d.svg" will look good.

There are also two versions of the logo that include a "gvSIG CE"
text. One (the full name) is intended for title slides, pages, etc.,
the other (abbreviated C.E.) for places where one-line high graphics
fit nicely, such as webpage or slide footers.
