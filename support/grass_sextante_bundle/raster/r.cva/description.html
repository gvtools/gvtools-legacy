<em><b>r.cva</b></em>  - Cumulative viewshed analysis program.
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<H2>QUICKSTART</H2>
To perform the most common cumulative viewshed analysis (for each cell of
the input elevation raster map: count the number of observer sites from which it
can be seen) type in the following:

<p>

<B>r.cva</B> <B>-f</B> <B>input=</B><EM>elevation</EM> <B>sites=</B><EM>observers</EM> <B>output=</B><EM>result</EM> <B>type=</B><EM>sites</EM>
<P>
'elevation' can be a raster map containing elevation values in CELL, FCELL or DCELL format. 'observers' must a map containing vector points.
'result' will be an output map in CELL format containing the cumulative visibility counts for each cell.

<A NAME = "description"><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2></A>

<EM>r.cva</EM> generates a cumulative viewshed map.  When run without
the <EM>-f</EM> flag each viewpoint is marked with the number of cells in its
viewshed (i.e. that can be seen from it).  In this mode the only cells
that contain genuine data in the output map are the viewpoints.
Alternatively, if the <EM>-f</EM> flag is set then each cell in the
<EM>output</EM> map is marked with the number of viewpoints from which
it can be seen.  In either case, viewpoints may be chosen in one of
four ways.  The first (`all') treats every cell as a viewpoint. This
is so computationally demanding that it is unlikely to be feasible
unless either the <EM>input</EM> map or <EM>max_dist</EM> is very
small.  The second (`systematic') uses a systematic sample of cells
arranged on a rectangular grid.  The third (`random') uses a random
sample.  By default the random sampling algorithm does not allow
replacement (i.e. a cell can be treated as a viewpoint only once), but
this behaviour can be altered by setting the <EM>-r</EM> flag.  The
fourth option (`sites') uses the points in the specified <EM>vector</EM>
map. The options `systematic' and `random' allow the user to specify
any sampling frequency between 0% and 100%.

<p>

The cells used in viewshed analysis can be constrained by one or both
of two masks. Both masks should be binary raster maps in which the
areas of interest are coded `1' and all other cells `0'.
<EM>target_mask</EM> determines which cells are targets: a cell which
is not a target will be returned as not visible from a given viewpoint
even if it is actually visible according to the line-of-sight analysis
(i.e. this mask performs the same function as <EM>patt_map</EM> in
<EM><A HREF="../../html/r.los.html">r.los</A></EM>).  <EM>viewpt_mask</EM>
constrains which cells may be treated as viewpoints.  For example,
suppose that the raster map `no_sea' codes sea (elevation = 0) as `0'
and land (elevation > 0) as `1'.  In this case, specifying `no_sea' as
the <EM>target_mask</EM> would cause <EM>r.cva</EM> to count cells on
land that are visible from any viewpoint.  Alternatively, specifying
`no_sea' as the <EM>viewpt_mask</EM> would count any cells visible
from viewpoints on land.  Finally, specifying `no_sea' as both the
<EM>target_mask</EM> and <EM>viewpt_mask</EM> would count cells on
land that are visible from viewpoints on land.

<p>

The geometry of the potential line of sight between each pair of cells
may be altered by means of two offsets, <EM>obs_elev</EM> and
<EM>target_elev</EM>. The height <EM>obs_elev</EM> is added to the
viewpoint and the height <EM>target_elev</EM> to each target cell.
Note that by swapping these values it is possible to produce maps
showing the number of cells from which a viewpoint is visible, or if
the <EM>-f</EM> flag is set, the number of viewpoints which it is
possible to see from each map cell.

<p>

A particular set of viewpoint locations in a random sample can be
repeated by specifying the same value for <EM>seed</EM>.
Alternatively, different values can be used to produce independent
samples for statistical testing.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<H3>Flags:</H3>
<DL>

<DT><B>-a</B>
<DD> Treat the specified sample size as an absolute number of cells
rather than a percentage.  Note, this flag is only for use with random
sampling.

<DT><B>-f</B>
<DD> Mark each cell in the output map with the number of viewpoints
from which it can be seen.

<DT><B>-h</B>
<DD> Adjust height of oberserver points so that they will never fall
below surface level. This is only useful in conjunction with the
<b>spot</b> parameter or attribute (see <A HREF ="#atributes">below</A>).

<DT><B>-i</B>
<DD> Do not interpret control attributes in input vector map as
described <A HREF ="#atributes">below</A>).

<DT><B>-m</B> <DD> Differentiate between genuine zero data values and
null data in the output map.  When the <EM>-f</EM> flag has not been
set this ensures that all non-viewpoint cells are coded `-1'.  When
the <EM>-f</EM> flag has been set then all cells coded `0' in the
<EM>target_mask</EM> (if there is one) are coded `-1'.  See <A HREF =
"#notes">below</A> for guidance when to set this flag.

<DT><B>-n</B> <DD> In conjunction with <B>-m</B>: write NULL values instead of '-1' to output map.

<DT><B>-o</B>	
<DD> Overwrite the output raster map if it already exists.

<DT><B>-q</B>	
<DD> Be quiet about progress, confirming only the output file and
sampling frequency.  This is useful when <EM>r.cva</EM> is invoked from a
script with standard output redirected to a disk file.

<DT><B>-r</B>
<DD> Allow replacement during random sampling (i.e. allow a given cell
to be picked as a viewpoint more than once).  Note that no cumulation
occurs for replacement viewpoints; this ensures that the resulting
cumulative viewshed will be as though the viewpoint was selected once
only (the final output map will, of course, be different because
replacement effectively results in the use of fewer viewpoints for a
given sampling frequency).

<DT><B>-s</B> <DD>Be silent about progress, in which case it is
strongly recommended that you use <EM><A
HREF="../../html/r.info.html">r.info</A></EM> to confirm what sampling frequency
was actually achieved.

<A NAME = "parameters"><H3>Parameters:</H3></A>

<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of a raster map layer containing elevation
data, used as program input.

<DT><B>target_mask=</B><EM>name</EM> <DD>Name of a binary raster map
layer in which target cells within the areas of interest are assigned
the category value `1' and all other cells are assigned the category
value `0'.  A cell is treated as a target when it is viewed from a
viewpoint (note, therefore, that viewpoints are targets when viewed
from other viewpoints).

<DT><B>viewpt_mask=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of a binary raster map layer in which viewpoints within the areas
of interest are assigned the category value `1' and all other cells
are assigned the category value `0'.

<DT><B>sites=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>The name of a vector map containing the sites (vector points) that are to be treated as
viewpoints.  Sites falling outside the current region are ignored.

<DT><B>obs_elev=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>Height of the observer (in metres) above the elevation of the
viewpoint.  Default: 1.75 m

<DT><B>target_elev=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>Height of the object of interest (in metres) above the elevation
of the target cell.  Default: 0.0 m

<DT><B>max_dist=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>Maximum distance (in metres) from the viewing point within which
the line-of-sight analysis will be performed.  Options: 0-99999
(stated in map units). Default: 100

<DT><B>seed=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>The seed for the random number generator used during random
sampling.  This option allows exact reproduction of a previous result.
Options: 0-32767. Default: 1

<DT><B>sample=</B><EM>value</EM>
<DD>The sampling frequency as a percentage of the number of map cells
in the current region.  Options: 0.0-100.0. Default: 10.0

<DT><B>type=</B><EM>value</EM> <DD>The type of sampling regime used to
select viewpoints for analysis. See <A HREF = "#description">above</A>
for details.  Options: `all', `systematic', `random', `sites'.

<DT><B>spot, offseta, offsetb, azimuth1, azimuth2, vert1, vert2, radius1, radius2</B>
<DD> See <A HREF ="#atributes">below</A>) for a description of what they do.

<DT><B>curvc=</B><EM>value</EM> 
<DD>Earth curvature correction will be applied if the distance from the observer
point exceeds the given threshold. Set this to 0.0 to disable curvature correction
(default). While correction slows down calculations, it is recommend for
viewing distances of more than about 3 km. The correction uses a simplified
formula which is accurate to 1 in 10,000 for distances up to 40 km:<p>
<i>d(height)=dist^2/(2*Re)</i><p>
With <i>Re</i> being the radius of the earth (ca. 6,356,766 m). 
</DL>




<A NAME = "attributes"><H3>Vector map attributes:</H3>

When using 'sites' type operation mode, <EM>r.cva</EM> checks for the
presence of a number of attributes in the input vector map's attribute table.
Each attribute, if present, must be of integer or double type. The following
attribute names and value ranges are recognised and interpreted:

<dl>
<dt>SPOT</dt>
	<dd>This determines absolute observer height. If this attribute is given,
	    observer height will no longer be determined from the DEM.
		 <EM>r.cva</EM> can automatically raise this value to that of the DEM 
		 point below the oberserver's position, if the value in SPOT would
		 cause the observer to get below ground level (use the <b>-h</b> flag).</dd>
<dt>OFFSETA</dt>
	<dd>Use this to add an offset to each oberver point's height. This is
	    just an alias for the <b>obs_elev</b> option and exists for
	    compatibility reasons.</dd>
<dt>OFFSETB</dt>
		<dd>The value stored in 'OFFSETB' will be added to each target point
		at the moment it is considered for visibility. All blocking points
		on the line-of-sight between observer and target will be left untouched.
		This is different from the <b>target_elev</b> parameter. It can be
		used to simulate visibility of targets with a certain height.</dd>
<dt>AZIMUTH1, AZIMUTH2</dt>
		<dd>These attributes must be given as values between 0.0 and 360.0 and
		can be used to limit the horizontal scan range of the viewshed.
		Limits are measured in degrees with 0.0 in the North and values
		increasing clock-wise. Thus, if you wanted to limit visibility scans
		to eastward directions only, you would set AZIMUTH1=1 and AZIMUTH2=180.
		</dd>
<dt>VERT1, VERT2</dt>
		<dd>In analogy to 'AZIMUTH1' and 'AZIMUTH2', these attributes can be
		used to limit the vertical range of the scan. The range is -90 to 0 for
		'VERT1' and 0 to 90 for 'VERT2'.
		At -90 degrees, the observer looks straight down to the ground and at
		90 degress up into the sky.
		</dd>
<dt>RADIUS1, RADIUS2</dt>
		<dd>Finally, two attributes exist to limit the distance of the scan.
		'RADIUS1' determines the minimum distance from the observer and 'RADIUS2'
		the maximum distance. The latter is thus equivalent to using the
		<b>max_dist</b> parameter and exists for compatibility reasons.
		</dd>
</dl>

Interpretation of these attributes can be turned off by using the <b>-i</b> flag.
<p>
Note that you can use the same control values in operation modes
other than 'sites', if you specify the equivalent parameters 
(see <A HREF = "#parameters">above</A>). The latter will also work
as global settings in 'sites' mode. Attributes stored in the vector
map table will override these global settings unless the <b>-i</b>
flag is specified. The meaning of <b>OFFSETA, OFFSETB</b> and <b>RADIUS1</b> is
the same as <b>obs_elev, target_elev</b> and <b>max_dist</b>. The latter still
exists for compatibility with earlier versions of <em>r.cva</em>.


<A NAME = "notes"><H2>NOTES</H2></A>

Input sites can also be 3D points, in which case absolute observer height is represented
by the z coordinate. If <em>spot=</em> has been specified or a 'SPOT' attribute is present
in the input map's attribute table, then these settings will override the z coordinate.
Make sure that the top and bottom settings of the current region are set to a range that
encompasses all points of interest (use <em>g.region -p -3</em> to review current 3D region
settings).
<P>

<EM>r.cva</EM> works in the current geographic region, but ignores the
current mask. Masking is achieved by specifying a target_mask and/or a
viewpt_mask. For accurate results, the program must be run with the
resolution of the geographic region set equal to the resolution of the
data (see <EM><A HREF="../../html/g.region.html">g.region</A></EM>).
<P>
This program assumes all height and distance measurements in meters.
Legacy units must be converted to meters by the user before running <EM>r.cva</EM>.
<P>
It is also assumed, that N-S and E-W resolution of the current region are the
same. If they differ, distances calculated for limiting the viewshed will
be imprecise and results affected accordingly.
<P>
The number of cells visible from a given viewpoint includes the
viewpoint itself only if the viewpoint is a target cell.
Consequently, if neither the viewpoint nor any other cell within
<EM>max_dist</EM> of it is a target cell then the size of that
viewpoint's viewshed will be zero. Set the <EM>-m</EM> flag to locate
such viewpoints (they will show as cells coded `0' as opposed to
`-1'). Similarly, set the <EM>-m</EM> flag when the <EM>-f</EM> flag has
been set in order to differentiate cells which are genuinely not
visible from any viewpoint as opposed to those that are not target
cells.
<P>
<EM>r.cva</EM> always informs the user what sampling frequency was
attempted and subsequently achieved.  This information is printed to
standard output and is also placed in the output map's history file
(which can be viewed using <EM><A HREF="../../html/r.info.html">r.info</A></EM>).
The sample attempted may differ slightly from that requested owing to
the need to sample a whole number of cells.  Any such discrepancy will
be greatest in the case of small maps of coarse resolution.  The
sample achieved may be further reduced when a <EM>viewpt_mask</EM> has been
specified.  This will not occur with the option `random', because its
algorithm repeatedly allocates viewpoints until the number that fall
within mask cells coded `1' produces the frequency attempted. Such a
reduction can, however, occur with the options `all', `systematic' and
`sites', because their algorithms allocate viewpoints without
reference to the mask and then simply ignore those that fall in mask
cells coded `0'.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Missing values in site attributes are currently not handled.
<p>

Earth curvature correction has not been sufficiently tested. The 'offsetb' option (=target_elev) 
has not been sufficiently tested. Please feel free to test and report!
<p>

When <EM>max_dist</EM> is set to 100, the N-S and E-W resolutions are
50, and a <EM>target_mask</EM> has been specified, the cells
immediately NE, SE, SW and NW of the viewpoint may not be masked when
then should be.  Please report any others that you find to the author.
<P>

Note that <EM>r.cva</EM> fixes two bugs in the current version of
<EM><A HREF="../../html/r.los.html">r.los</A></EM>: that <EM>obs_elev</EM> is
truncated to its integer component and that the target mask
(<EM>patt_map</EM> in <EM><A HREF="../../html/r.los.html">r.los</A></EM>) does
not apply to the viewpoint or its eight immediate neighbours.
