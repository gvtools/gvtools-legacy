/* Modified from r.los by MWL on 14/12/95 to:-
 * 
 * Updated by Mark Lake on 17/8/01 for GRASS 5.x
 * 
 * 1) Detach a point structure from the linked list.
 *
 * Version 3.0, differs from v.1.0 as follows:-
 *
 * 1) Recieves cell_no and writes to segment file at deleted point.
 *    This ensures that make_point3.c can differentiate between a
 *    point that has been deleted during the current los analysis,
 *    and one which was deleted or counted during los
 *    analysis from a preceeding viewpoint.
 *
 * Implicated files:-
 *
 * 1) See main3.c.
 *
 * Modifications to r.los:-
 *
 * 1) Writes cell_no to seg_out_p instead of value 1.
 *
 * Called by:-
 * 
 * 1) hidden_point_elimination()
 *
 * Calls:-
 *
 * 1)  None. */
