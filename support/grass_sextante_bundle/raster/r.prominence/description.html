<H2>NAME</H2>
<em><b>r.prominence</b></em>  - calculates local prominence statistic.
<BR>
<EM>(GRASS Raster Program)</EM>

<A NAME = "description"><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2></A>

<EM>r.prominence</EM> computes a local neighborhood statistic that indicates
by how much a cell differs from the <EM>n</EM> cells surrounding it. In the
case of an elevation raster, this can be taken as the "prominence" of a location
in relation to its neighborhood. There is a growing body of literature on
the topic of topographic prominence in fields such as physical geography
and archaology. The statistic implemented in <EM>r.prominence</EM> is relatively
simple. The prominence "P" for a cell "i" is calculated as:
<p>
<em>P=value(i)/avg</em>
</p>
Where <em>avg</em> is the average value of the cells in the neighborhood of <em>i</em>.
<p>
There are different ways of expressing prominence within a neighborhood.
Please take a look at the description of the flags below to make sure that the
output fits your purpose.

<H2>USAGE DETAILS</H2>

<H3>Flags:</H3>
<DL>

<DT><B>-a</B>
<DD> Calculates "absolute" prominence. This leads to features with great negative
difference from their surroundings (such as a deep canyon) to be marked as "positively prominent".
If this flag is given, then the normalization modes (see below) will produce output
in the range of "0" to "1" only. All output cell values will be positive.

<DT><B>-g</B>
<DD> Normalizes output data to the range "-1" (minimal) to "1" (maximal) across
the whole input raster. This makes it possible to compare different locations with each
other, based on how prominent they are over the entire study region.

<DT><B>-l</B>
<DD> Normalizes output data to the range "-1" (minimal) to "1" (maximal) within
a neighborhood. This makes it possible to compare different locations with each
other, based on how prominent they are within their local environment.

<DT><B>-r</B>
<DD> Use a square instead of a circular neighborhood approximation. This will
result in faster computation but will be a less realistic assumption in many
scenarios (such as when using topographic prominence as a proxy for "visibility").

<DT><B>-q</B>	
<DD> Disable progress display.


<A NAME = "parameters"><H3>Parameters:</H3></A>

<DT><B>input=</B><EM>name</EM>
<DD>Name of a raster map layer containing elevation
data, used as program input.

<DT><B>radius=</B><EM>value</EM> <DD>Radius of neighborhood to use for computation,
expressed as number of cells. The larger, the more processing time will be needed. 
This parameter represents the scale-dependency of the statistic: Larger radii will 
accentuate features that are prominent over a larger area, whereas smaller radii will 
also accentuate those features that only stick out in their immediate neighborhood.


<A NAME = "notes"><H2>NOTES</H2></A>
Computation of the prominence statistic can be time-consuming, especially for
raster maps with many cells and for large neighborhoods. Local normalization takes much
longer than global normalization.
<p>
The prominence statistic is fully subject to the "modifiable areal unit" (MAU) effect.
Towards the edges of the input raster, results will get unreliable. Therefore, make sure to allow
for sufficient buffer space (the size of <em>radius=</em>) in the input raster around all locations of interest.
