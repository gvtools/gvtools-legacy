- Change radius units
	- expressing the radius in cells is not a good idea, because
          the diagonal distance through a cell is larger then the
          horiz or vert, so this introduces counter-intuitive
          inaccuracies
 	- better let user specify radius in map units
	- respect lat/lon regions

- Speed-up
	- pre-calculate a raster mask that indicate thos cells in
	  the neighborhood which are within the radius
          (same as r.fill.gaps)
	- replace "if" logics in main loop with function pointers
	  (same as r.fill.gaps)
	- look for further optimization opportunities
