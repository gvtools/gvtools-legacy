Replacements modules r.walk, r.cost and r.drain.

In the GRASS 6.5 branch, a crucial backlink feature
has been added to those modules. This change has
apparently never been backported to 6.4.

Therefore, we will replace these modules with the
6.5 versions, unless a 6.4.x update takes care of
this for us.
