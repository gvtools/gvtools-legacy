Because it would be possible for an archaeological site to be located in an area of relatively high exposure yet, because of local terrain, remain invisible to other sites in the vicinity, an additional topographic measure was included in the study. Kvamme’s Ridge Index was used because it is a measure of view potential. The algorithm that calculates this index is designed to measure the “angle of unobstructed horizontal view from a given location” (Kvamme 1983: 28). First discussed by Brown (1979) as a way to measure view potential for Late Prehistoric sites in Kansas, this index is based on the 360 degrees of a compass. Written in C by Kvamme and George Ball to work with ARC/INFO files, this algorithm passes a local neighborhood window over the surface of a DEM. At each cell, it uses the elevation of the center, or target cell, as the vertex of an elevation contour. Extending the contour to the edge of the 3 X 3 window, it calculates the angle of this contour and writes this value into the target cell of the new raster (Figure 11a). High scores indicate hilltop and ridge locations with their wide viewing angles, low scores correspond to drainages and their reduced viewing angles, and scores around 180 are indicative of sites located mid-slope or in plains settings (Figure 11b) (Kvamme 1992b). The view potential map for the Umayri region can be seen in Figure 12. Here the dark cells are ridges with their wide viewing angles, and the light cells are drainages with their restricted view potential.
