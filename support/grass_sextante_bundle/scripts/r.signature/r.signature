# Computes multi-raster signatures for vector objects.

# IDEAS
# - use r.param.scale instead of r.slope.aspect for more robust estimates of slope, aspect, etc.
#   (can use this with varying window sizes: more accurate than changing raster resolution)
# - store means of raster metrics as attribute table fields
# - take formulas for vector shape metrics from SEXTANTE's tool
# - use short and simple, abbreviated attribute field names to store the signatures
