# Extracts cells from an input raster maps if the fall into (a) user-specified range(s)

# Input: raster map and list of ranges (unordered): ranges=0,20-30,1-20
# Ranges may overlap
#
# Selectable mode for extraction:
#
# Min <= x <= Max
# Min < x < Max 
#
# Just a convenient wrapper around r.mapcalc, really
