# r.type
# Changes data (storage) type of a raster dataset

# This script can be used to e.g. change all cells in a GDA-supported 
# raster dataset from type "byte" to type "int16".

# It has mostly been written to provide a type converter for Java GIS 
# that cannot handle unsigned byte types. It uses direct GDAL access to
# the data source, bypassing any data management of the host GIS.

# - use r.in.gdal/r.out.gdal
# - allow explicit setting of "no data" value
