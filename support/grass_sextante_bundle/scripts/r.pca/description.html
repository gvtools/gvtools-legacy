<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.pca</em>
performs Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on a series of input raster maps.
Its intention is to provide a convenient way for running <em><a href="i.pca.html">i.pca</a></em>
and producing a multi-band GeoTIFF result file. Such files are suitable for visualization
of multi-dimensional datasets in many GIS. GRASS, however, is not very well-suited for handling
multi-band raster datasets. Thus, for PCA inside a GRASS session, the original <em><a href="i.pca.html">i.pca</a></em>
should be used.
    
<h2>USAGE NOTES</h2>

At least two input maps are required to compute the first two principal components of
the data. In most cases, components higher than "3" will contain very little useful
information. The <em>components=</em> option controls which ones to preserve
and embed as bands into the GeoTIFF output file. Note that the order of components
(bands) in the file will be as specified in this option. Note also that all possible
components (as many as there are input maps) are always computed even if not all of
them will be preserved. So the (temporary) disk space required for their computation will exceed
that required for storing the actual result file.  

<p>

It is possible to use input raster maps of different extents and resolutions.
The result will always be computed within the current GRASS region settings (see <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em>).
However, in such cases it may be advisable to explicitly transform all input raster
maps to a common cell resolution first and in a well-controlled fashion, e.g.
by using <em><a href="r.resamp.interp.html">r.resamp.interp</a></em>.

<p>

If the aim is to produce visualizations by assigning differents bands to R/G/B or H/I/S channels,
then it makes sense to rescale the output data to the integer range of [0..255], supported by
common PC graphics hardware (default). If the raw data is required for analytical purposes, scaling can be
turned off by setting <em>scaling=0,0</em>.

<p>

The GeoTIFF output file will be compressed using the LZW method. Optionally, a world file
(.tfw) may be produced to accompany the GeoTIFF dataset. 

<p>    

Please refer to the original manual page of <em><a href="i.pca.html">i.pca</a></em> for further
details on the data processing approach.

<h2>CAVEATS</h2>

<b>Windows Users:</b> Due to a bug in <em><a href="g.parser.html">g.parser</a></em>, known
to exist in GRASS versions up to 6.4.1, it is necessary to provide the output path and file
name in double quotes ("). E.g.: <em>output="C:\Documents\output_file.tif"</em>.
