<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.add.vect</em> adds or overlays ("stamps") vector objects into a raster map using a constant or attribute field value.
This is useful for adding buildings or vegetation blocks to a DEM and similar operations.

<h2>USAGE NOTES</h2>

The default mode of operation is to read a value from a user-specified attribute table field of the input vector map.

The objects in the vector map are then rasterized using the current GRASS region's extent and resolution and the values of the attribute table field as cell values.

Finally, the rasterized objects are added to the cells in the existing raster input map to produce the new raster output.

<p>

Set <em>"use=attr"</em> (default) and provide an attribute field name in <em>"column="</em> for the default mode of operation.

Alternatively, rasterize all objects with a constant value by setting <em>"use=val"</em> and providing the constant value in <em>"value="</em>

<p>

It is also possible to "stamp" the rasterize objects into the existing raster maps, by setting all cells that fall into a rasterized object to that object's (or a constant) raster value, instead of adding them to the existing cell values.

<p>

This module will process all input vector objects in layer "1".

Only objects of type "point", "line" or "area" will be processed.
