# v.in.wkt
#
# Purpose: Parse a geometry description in WKT and produce a GRASS geometry
# 
# - user can either specify on WKT string as input, or a file which
#   is assumed to contain one such string per line (or commented or empty lines)
# - create a temporary CSV from input and use OGR's CSV driver to import the string(s)
# - allow user to also specify attribute table structure and values (?)
# - also provide a v.out.vtk?
# - add new geometries to a new or existing map
