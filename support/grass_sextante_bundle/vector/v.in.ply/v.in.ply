PLY is a simple format for point clouds and triangle
meshes

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_%28file_format%29

There are already two shell scripts "v.in.ply" and
"v.out.ply" in the GRASS Add-ons repository. They
import/export basic ASCII pointclouds:

However, the PLY format also has a binary version,
and it supports triangles, normals and RGB as attributes.

So to make full use of this format, a re-implementation
using one of the open source PLY C libraries is required.
