By definition, all of a polygon's vertices must lie on the same
plane (co-planarity). This is also true for 3D polygons.
Currently, GRASS does not have a tool to enfore co-planarity
for the vertices that make up a polygon. This means that invalid
polygons that are not co-planar slip past the topology check and
create problems later on (e.g. in 3D visualization).

[v.clean should also have the ability to at least check for co-planarity]

Enforcing co-planarity might also be an interesting option for
line strings and even point sets in some applications.

Once a polygon is co-planar, it is also straight-forward to assign
it a proper 3D centroid, which can be advantageous for 3D labeling.

This algorithm finds the plane equation for a set of vertices:

Once the plane equation is known, enforcing co-planarity is
a simple matter of reprojecting all original vertices to
the plane defined by the plane equation.
