*** GRASS ***
- contour polygons: modify r.surf.contour: fill in-between contours using higher
  value only; improve "no data" handling
- trend surfaces
- ortho rectification
- v.rast.stats: allow user to also save shape metrics into the attribute table


*** TEMPORARY LAYERS ***
- check which ones are temp layers (easy: just check their paths):
    - use different icon
    - offer "Make permanent":
        - allow user to specify a new path and (base) file name


*** RASTER LAYERS ***
- should we issue a warning, if a .rmf file's creation date is older than its 
  associated raster file? Would that work on Windows file systems?


*** General UI ***
- configurable MDI background


*** SEXTANTE TOOLS ***
- add more metrics to "Grid statistics in polygon"
- allow KDE to run without a count field


*** SEXTANTE/GRASS Interface ***
- allow user to link (2D) vectors instead of importing them
- switch to r.external, unless user explicitely selects not to


*** BUGS: WINDOWS ***
- cannot call GRASS shell scripts from within GRASS shell scripts
- modules get blocked forever on vector import ops (seen on 64 bit Win XP and 7)
  Maybe a problem with Data Execution Prevention?
  To disable DEP by modifying the Boot.ini file, change the /noexecute policy level to alwaysoff.
  /NoExecute=AlwaysOff</ul> 
- SEXTANTE: lang translation files do not get applied (seen on 64 bit Win XP)
- file handles for deletes layers are not released


*** BUGS: Mac OS X ***
- Raster "Save As" results in NULL pointer error
- trouble with Java widgets (drop-down lists)


*** BUGS: ALL ***
- Raster layers lose contrast/get painted in one colour whenever the data
  view exceeds a certain size (projects with multiple views only?) 


*** BINARIES ***
- GDAL 1.7
- 64 bit binaries
- update PROJ4


*** SEXTANTE INTERFACE ***
- Toolbox should not be an MDI window


*** SEXTANTE R INTEGRATION ***
- wrap R scripts with XML descriptor files, just like GRASS modules
- could write pseudo GRASS modules that actually pass options and flags to an R script 
- provide a basic R setup script to be run be each one of the modules, use custom
  R code afer that; provide another unified output script
- this would even work from within GRASS! (R.* modules)
- in SEXTANTE, we could easily sort this scripts into their own hierarchy in the
  tree, but they would still need installed GRASS support (minimal)
- cool thing would be that via the GRASS extension we would have all input/output
  stuff covered
- in SEXTANTE, we can convert vector map inputs to table inputs for all those R
  modules that do not require spatial input (tables include attribute tables)


*** VECTOR FORMATS ***
- support direct loading of:
  - MapInfo
  - E00
  - ... (?)
  

*** RASTER FORMATS ***
- support more GDAL extensions for loading
- fix problem with large CORINE raster loading (INT vs LONG mem allocation problem?)
- support previews for IMAGINE output


*** BUGS ***
- Crash when reprojecting raster from/to non-EPSG system
- Project file write error when trying to "Save as" a raster to a Windows network drive


*** TRANSLATION ***
- Rename: "Print layout" = "Screen/paper space"
- find all remaining hard-coded strings


*** ERROR HANDLING ***
- find all error conditions that are not caught properly


*** SQLITE/SPATIALITE SUPPORT ***
- tabular data and spatial


*** POSTGIS ***
- integrate those collaborative editing tools (see QGIS implementation).
- integrate PostGIS WKT raster extension
- integrate PostGIS layer settings extension


*** CAD EDITOR ***
- 3D coordinates input and ortho views
- fix centering of data view with console open
- textual geometry editing
- visualize nodes and label them with coords
- multi-part features working?
- Snakes
- Copy & Paste (incl. 3D)


*** TABLES ***
- Look-up lists (being worked on)
- Improv ODBC connections dialog
- Better CSV import ((multiple)delimiters, row skipping, comments, encoding, text delims, ...)
- Better editing/navigation in tables
- Working import of DBF IV tables exported from Access


*** POINTS FROM TABLE ***
- Prevent project tables from being deleted by the "Points from table" tool
  (happens, when the virtual points layer is deleted)
- support lat/lon notation in deg
- support Z and M fields
- directly create Shapefiles instead of vitual layer


*** NORMALIZATION EXT ***
- text encoding setting
- more accurate preview (filter out text delimiters, set decimal symbols correctly)
- fix bug with fields reshuffling when adding a new definition in the middle of the list
- why does it create a 0 bytes DBF file? What should it really create? A DBF? A database table
  in an existing connection?


*** VECTOR SYMBOLOGY ***
- Set default scaling to "Print layout"
- Faster initial display of symbol libraries
- Global settings for all classes for transparency,fill,outline, etc.


*** COLOR TABLES ***
- Alphabetical sorting of color tables
- Display of table names in vector layer color tables selector
- NULL cells should not have any color in preview


*** TOC ***
- Standard keyboard shortcuts for Cut, Copy & Paste
- Proper drag'n'drop indicator
- fix problem with truncated layer names
- fix spurious opening of symbol lists and groups


*** PROJECT MANAGER ***
- Make dialog properly resizable
- Allow reordering list items
- Decrease size of object type icons, pick better ones
- Rename "Map" object to "Layout"


*** GENERAL GUI ***
- better and bigger toolbar icons
- stop "icon jumping"
- make toolbars freely positionable horiz/vert (add handles)
- check keyboard shortcuts
- unify dialog behavior and resizing (ooph!)
- native file selectors (?)
- make sure that ONLY data windows are MDI windows
- make sure all functions available via context menus are also available via the menu bar
- Maximization mode for MDI windows: hide windows title bar and put window management icons into gvSIG menu bar


*** FIELD CALCULATOR ***
- Z coordinate operations
- op for replacing string values with numerical codes
- better dialog behavior and resizing


*** LABELS ***
- Set default scaling to "Print layout"
- Fix label preview
- Test and fix remaining problems with advanced labels
- Halos
- Break-out labels (interactive)
- Text search in labels


*** GEO REFERENCER ***
- clean-up and bug fixes (needs many)
- Helmert transformation
- two-point transformation
- GDAL warping transformation


*** DATA VIEW ***
- configurable coordinate display precision
- introduce a neutral default tool


*** MAP LAYOUT ***
- better scale bars
- ID->Label legend style (print IDs for labels, display texts in legend)
- more configurable graticules
- fix problems with graying out and ATI gfx card drivers' 2D accel settings
- ortho data views and other stuff to support technical drawings
- export to SVG


*** (RE)PROJECTIONS ***
- support for vector affine world files
- support for unprojected, local coordinate systems (x/y non-world)


*** REMOTE SENSING ***
- get ALL the tools working!


*** RASTER TOOLS ***
- Cropping: Take extents from current view
- Add a simple raster cell editor


*** DATA MANAGEMENT ***
- implement a "Move data" and "Copy data" function
  This can be used to e.g. make temp layers permanent
  (under a new name)
