GRASS vector lib has full 3D coordinate support, but only 2D topology.

GRASS core enhancements:

Terminology: primitives and composites (areas, edges, volumes)

Need to implement:
	Edges (=3D areas) ???
	Kernel (=3D centroid for both edges and volumes)
	Volumes (=closed 3D meshes)
	
-> include/vect/dig_structs.h has all the primitive and composite
types (what does n_edges in struct Plus_head refer to?).
The version in GRASS 7 is already more elaborate (see Plus_head)

Topology management for volumes: holes and kernels, testing for kernel
in volume; v.build must be able to recognize closed meshes (volumes) around
kernels and do mesh -> volume (otherwise, how to import volume data? no
other GIS seems to have that primitive).

Topology management

3D module enhancements:

v.buffer: create 3D volume buffers
v.hull: create a 3D volume as a result, not faces
v.kernel: output voxel density map

 NEW 3D modules:
 
 v.in.ply/v.out.ply
 -> http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/professional/rply/ !!!

Eventually, it would be nice to make VTK processing
available for GRASS vector maps (maybe expose the
algorithm via a module):

VTK Triangulation: decompose complex polygons into simple triangles
VTK Delaunay 3D (see ParaView 3.6)

CGAL library for computational geometry
