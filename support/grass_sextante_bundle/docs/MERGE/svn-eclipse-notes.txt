Eclipse and the SVN plugin have been used to checkout:

  http://subversion.gvsig.org/gvSIG/tags/v1_9_Build_1253

It contains Andami, the main gvSIG app and all extensions and libraries.
This is a _tag_ which represents a dead code tree.

Current development (bug fixing etc.) for 1.9 is going on in:

  http://subversion.gvsig.org/gvSIG/trunk

So, the Eclipse project needs to be kept up-to-date by merging bug
fixes from trunk into it, but without destroying the OA modifications
done to our own build 1253!

Recent changes and affected files can be viewed from the Eclipse SVN
plugin, using "History" from the "trunk" folder context menu.

A list of all SVN changes can be retrieved from trunk using:

  svn log http://subversion.gvsig.org/gvSIG/trunk --verbose > svn-log.txt

This will store a _very_ long and complete log in svn-log.txt.
To cut it down to only the recent changes (i.e. after build 1253), look
for this entry:

"v1_9_Build_1253"

... and delete all lines below that entry.

A list of all OA-modified files is kept in "src". That directory has been
added to the workspace as project "_0A changes".

Single changed files can be extracted from SVN by using the "Export"
function in the context menu and saving the file to the corresponding
folder in the local workspace tree.

The most important bug fixes of a specific build can be queried in Trac
by using a custom query statement like:

  resolve build number [contains] [1254]

---

Extensions that were never modified should simply be deleted from 
workspace and re-imported from trunk (do a fresh "Checkout").

[DONE] for:
binaries
extGraph
extI18n
extPublish
extSymbology
extTopology
libDwg
libGeocoding

These projects can be synchronized with SVN by using
"Team->Update to HEAD" from the context menu.

---

The file svn-log-past-1253.txt contains only those changes that have
NOT been imported into the OA build yet, for diverse reasons.
