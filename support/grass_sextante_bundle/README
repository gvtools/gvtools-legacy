*******************************************
* THE INTEGRATED GRASS DISTRIBUTION (IGD) *
*******************************************


*** WHAT'S THIS? ***

This directory contains additional GRASS modules which
are not part of the current stable GRASS distribution,
but are found in various add-on repositories.
Such modules are included if they provide significant
functionality gain and are deemed stable enough for general
usage.

It also contains some improved versions of official distribution
modules that provide some significant benefits to users but
are officially still in testing stage.
Such modules are included here if the value of their improvements
is deemed higher than the risk of them being unstable.

These modules are meant to work with the latest stable GRASS GIS
release. At the time of writing, that was GRASS 6.4.


*** HOW DO I COMPILE THIS? ***

Only the source code for the individual modules is here,
not a complete GRASS source tree and no configuration system.

To compile these modules and integrate them into a GRASS
binary distribution, you first need to download the source code
for the latest stable GRASS release from here:

  http://grass.fbk.eu/

Next, extract the source code to a directory on your system
and run the script included in this directory with the path
to that directory as only parameter:

  make_links.sh <path_to_grass_sources>

These instructions should work on any Linux or "POSIX-like"
system, including Mac OS X, and also the MinGW/MSYS environment
on Windows.

This will create links to all modules into the GRASS source code
tree. You can then configure the GRASS sources normally, compile
and install. The result should contain all the extra modules.
(But see warning below!)

Read the comments at the beginning of make_links.sh for further
information.


*** HOW DOES THIS WORK WITH MS VISUAL C ON WINDOWS? ***

No idea. If I were to help Microsoft to spread and sell 
their software, they'd have to pay me, first.

************
* WARNING! *
************

Some of the modules in this directory may be replacements for
existing GRASS modules. In these cases, the existing GRASS
sources will be deleted and the ones here linked in, instead.

Do not run make_links.sh on a GRASS source code tree with code
that you actively work on or that's connected to an SVN
repository. It will mess up your code!!!
