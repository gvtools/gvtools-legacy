This version of SEXTANTE for gvSIG is specifically designed to run with
gvSIG CE. Unfortunately, you are not running gvSIG CE, so some features
might not be available or might not work as expected. While you can
still use most of SEXTANTE capabilities, please consider using gvSIG CE
for a full SEXTANTE experience and additional features such as
<ul>
<li>Integration of native gvSIG geoalgorithms in the SEXTANTE
toolbox</li>
<li>Integration of third party algorithm providers (R, SAGA,
GRASS...)</li>
</ul>
