NOTES ON SOME GRASS MODULES
---------------------------



r.xtent
-------

This has been completely reworked and the number of options reduced
drastically, mostly because cost and friction surfaces now have to
be generated by the user with other tools.
To burn linear features into friction surfaces with closing vertical
gaps, the script r.burn.frict was developed.
THE DOCUMENTATION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED COMPLETELY.


r.burn.frict
------------

This is a shell script. It's unclear whether it should have a .sh extension
(Windows?). Take a look at a WinGRASS installation to clarify.


r.quantiles
-----------

GRASS has r.quantiles, which uses a (refinable) number of approximate
classes to sort the distribution. It generates codes that can be piped
to r.recode:

  r.quantile input=dem quantiles=10 -r
  r.recode input=dem output=tmp --o rules=tmp.txt -d
  r.stats input=tmp -cl

r.mapcalc dem2="if(dem==0.000000,null(),dem)"

Problem: given there should be no data overlap between areas, then cell
counts in the individual areas can be significantly different when the
data is skewed.

In that case, significance testing is not that straight-forward anymore.
Significance testing would also be hampered if we used a large number of
bins, because then we need quite a large sample to see anything in the
distribution.

Also: sorting cells into bins EXACTLY will be very heavy on memory consumption!
