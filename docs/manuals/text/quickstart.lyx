Important information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document was originally written for gvSIG version 1.1.2 and the OADE
 distribution based on that version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, we no longer have the resources to maintain a comprehensive
 user guide for current releases of gvSIG, so this guide has been discontinued.
 We still provide it as most of the information also applies to the current
 release of gvSIG.
 But there will be no updates in the foreseeable future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those sections, that do not apply to the current version of gvSIG at all
 anylonger have been completely removed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 it, you have the following options:

Welcome to the gvSIG OA Digital Edition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GvSIG (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.gvsig.gva.es
\end_layout

\end_inset

) is a free and open source Geoinformation System (GIS), that enables you
 to interactively visualise, manage, modify and analyse spatial information
 in the form of digital maps, images and database tables.
 It is easy to learn, yet versatile and efficient enough for demanding GIS
 tasks and above all freely available, at no charge and under a license
 that emphasizes your freedom of use rather than restrictions.
 It is a cross-platform application, based on Sun's Java technology, which
 currently runs on Windows (2000/XP/Vista), Linux and Mac OS X operating
 systems, giving you great flexibility in its deployment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At Oxford Archaeology, we believe that gvSIG has matured into a powerful
 GIS tool that can be used productively in many working environments, especially
 when used in combination with other open source solutions such as GRASS
 GIS (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.grass.itc.it
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 However, the complex installation procedure and linguistic deficiencies
 of the English user interface translation have caused unnecessary irritations
 for users and we have thus committed ourselves to providing a more polished,
 accessible version of the software.
 The result of our efforts is this OA Digital Edition of gvSIG.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This edition is based on gvSIG 1.1.2.
 It is provided 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

as-is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We do not intend to produce updates for the 1.1.x line of this software as
 we will focus our resources on the next version of gvSIG (2.0).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This guide is meant to be a quick introduction to the software which should
 get you started in a matter of minutes.
 It is not meant to replace the much more exhaustive, official User Guide
 which can be downloaded from the gvSIG project page.
 Once you have worked through this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quickstart guide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and have got a basic feeling for how things work in gvSIG, we advise you
 to consult the User Guide in depth to develop a more complete understanding
 of the software's capabilities.
 We also assume that you have some prior experience with using GIS and know
 the fundamental concepts and terminology.

\begin_layout Subsection
The gvSIG user interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main window of gvSIG consists of the main menu bar on the top of the
 screen and one or more rows of icons just below it providing shortcuts
 for often needed functions.
 GvSIG arranges child windows (for viewing data, designing map layouts,
 managing tables etc.) inside the main window.
 You can change the size and position of child windows only within the limits
 of the main window.
 This multi document interface (MDI) approach is something that Windows
 users will probably be more accustomed to than Linux and Mac OS X users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important thing to know is that 
\series bold
the contents of both the main menu bar and the icon area will change depending
 on what child window or element of a child window (such as a layer in a
 data view) is currently active
\series default
.
 The gvSIG user interface will only expose those functions to you that you
 can actually apply in any given situation.
 If you start gvSIG for the first time, you will notice the Project manager
 window.

The project manager
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project manager provides a way of working with several data views and
 map layouts within one project.
 You can even copy and paste many types of data, such as GIS layers, between
 objects in the project manager.
 It contains the sections

 The

Basic Usage

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will discuss how to get GIS data into a project.
 GvSIG supports many different modes of geodata storage, such as files,
 database tables and web services.
 In this guide, we will only look into the typical file-based operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select the view you just created from the list and click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Open
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A new window will open which contains three empty areas.
 On the left, there is room for the list of GIS data layers (to be added
 in a moment) and an overview map area below it.
 The bigger part of the view to the right is the display area for the actual
 data.
 If you activate the new view window (e.g.
 by clicking on its title frame) and click on its window to bring it to
 the foreground, new entries

Getting data into gvSIG

\begin_layout Standard
For example, to add a vector data layer based on an ESRI Shapefile, choose
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

View\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Add layer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the main menu (make sure that a data view window is active to see
 these menu options) or click on the corresponding icon in the icon bar.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

File
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tab allows you to import (among others) ESRI Shapefiles.
 So make sure that it is activated and choose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Add
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Browse for Shapefiles on your file system (make sure to set the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Files of Type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 option to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

).
 Use the SHIFT and CTRL keys to select multiple files if you want, then
 click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Open
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will add all selected files to the list of files to be imported.
 You can keep adding more files to the list in this way if you wish.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also want to choose an SRS for the data (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Current projection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 If you choose an SRS that differs from the one in the current view, then
 gvSIG will automatically re-project the imported data into the view's SRS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

OK
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The Shapefiles should now get added as new vector layers to the layer list

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make a selection of features in that layer.
 Try to reduce the selection as much as possible, as spatial tests can be
 computationally expensive and take a long time.

Remember that the ESRI Shapefile standard requires you to have at least
 one field in the attribute table.
 By default, attribute tables are stored in DBase (DBF) format, which imposes
 some restrictions.
 Any field name should not exceed 10 characters in length and consist of
 alpha-numeric symbols only.
 Do not use any whitespace, use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Using mathematical operators, such as the

\begin_layout Standard
The project manager has a section

 These can be the attribute tables of layers or external tables not initially

Example: IDW interpolation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at how to run a simple inverse distance weighting interpolation
 to create a raster elevation model using the SEXTANTE tools.
 Make sure there is a vector point map with an elevation field in its attribute
 data table in one of your project's data views.
 Then open the SEXTANTE toolbox by clicking on the little 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 icon.

Use extent from layer

 Finally, set the cell size to a value that results in a reasonable number
