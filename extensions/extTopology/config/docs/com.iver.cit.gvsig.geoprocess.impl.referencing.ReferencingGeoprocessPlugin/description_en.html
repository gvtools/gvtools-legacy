This geoprocess applies a spatial transformation to all features of a layer.
</P>
The supported transformation methods are:
<ul>
<li>Projective</li>
<li>Affine</li>
<li>Similarity</li>
<li>Bursa-Wolf</li>
<li>Differential Rubber Sheeting</li>
<li>Constrained Affine</li>
</ul>
<P>
<P>
Required input consists of a set of source and target control point coordinates.
</P>
<P>
Source and target points are introduced into the table of error vectors
by dragging a vector interactively from source to target in the current View.
</p>

</P>
<P>
Each transformation method requires a specific minimum number of control points. 
If more than the minimum number of points are available, then the quality of the transformation 
can usually by improved by a root mean square adjustment.
</p>
<P>
To allow assessment of transformation quality, A root mean square error will be provided for each control point, 
as well as for the whole set.
